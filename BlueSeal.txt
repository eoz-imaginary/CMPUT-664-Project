Sequence of steps to build:
1) Install BlueSeal from MultiFlow GitHub repo
---> BlueSeal artifact from official BlueSeal repo does not build!
2) Call BlueSeal using Multiflow with the following command:
---> java -cp multiflowAPI.jar edu.buffalo.cse.blueseal.main.Main <path/to/some/APK>


Detailed evaluation: 
BlueSeal builds without error, but was noted to crash with a variety of runtime exceptions on 72% of all Android APKs tested. However, the remaining 28% of APKs analyzed produced the anticipated results that matched the data provided by the authors.

Verification status: finished

Note: Due to the artifact producing the correct results over 25% of the time, this artifact is tentatively marked as reproducible. However, due to the numerous runtime errors encountered, this "finished" result must be taken with a very large grain of salt.
