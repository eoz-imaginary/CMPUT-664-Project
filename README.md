# CMPUT-664-Project

This repository contains supplemental files to the final report written for my CMPUT 664 Secure Software Engineering class. A breakdown of its contents is as follows: 

BlueSeal Results: in-depth results pertaining to which Android APK files successfully ran, and if not, which ones crashed with which errors. 

BlueSeal/CUSPER/PScout/PScout II: formatted text files adhering to the submission guidelines of Brown University's "repo-repe-repro" database (http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Examining-Reproducibility/). Each file contains information on the steps taken to run each artifact, problems encountered, and whether or not it was deemed reproducible.
