Sequence of steps to build:
1) mkdir <android_class_dir> #create new directory under PScout dir
2) cd <android_class_dir>
3) ../bin/setupanalysis.sh <android_dir> #<android_dir> is root directory of android source code)

Detailed evaluation: 
- Step 3 fails with a "no such file or directory" error. PScout is specifically looking for the directory <android_dir>/frameworks/base/core/, which does not exist in any official android version.
